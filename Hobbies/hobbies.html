		<h2>Fishing</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Fishing is one of the greatest past times in my opinion. We get stuck inside way
				to much now days. Its great to just be outside and enjoy the world
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Coding</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				It is not really a hobby anymore. I just love to code anytime I have down time. I
				used to game when I was bored but now the coding bug has got me. Nothing beats
				learning something new every day.
